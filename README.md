> **Note:** Python is **not required** if you use the compiled version.  
> The `Nexcord.zip` already includes a ready-to-use `.exe`, so you can just extract and run it without installing Python.

### Settings:
- [x] - **Windows 10 / 11**
- [x] - **Download Python:** [v3.9.11](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.11/python-3.9.11-amd64.exe)
- [x] - **Fequently Updating**
- [x] - **Python Provided**

## Installation
> If you get a warning that the app cannot be opened, click **"Run Anyways"**.  
> You may need to click **"More info"** to see this option.
>
> This warning is entirely harmless and only appears because the app is not signed.  
> Code signing would cost us [**upwards of 300€/year**](https://shop.certum.eu/data-security/code-signing-certificates/certum-ev-code-sigining.html).
